	Abstract = {In this chapter we discuss behavior of waves at dielectric and conductor interfaces as well as scattering from bodies. The problem of conditions at the interfaces between two materials is a fundamental problem in testing. Many of the methods we use later depend on measurement of reflected or transmitted waves from a single interface or from multiple interfaces. To define the reflected fields, we define the reflection and transmission coefficients for a variety of interfaces.},

@inproceedings{Werner2016,
	Abstract = {We extend the Wave Digital Filter (WDF) approach to simulate reference circuits that involve operational amplifiers (op-amps). We handle both nullor-based ideal op-amp models and controlled-source-based linear op-amp macromodels in circuits with arbitrary topologies using recent derivations for complicated scattering matrices. The presented methods greatly increase the class of appropriate circuits for virtual analog modeling, and readily extend to circuits with any number of op-amps. Although op-amps are essential to many circuits and deviations from ideal can be important, previous WDF research applies only to the limited case of circuits with ideal op-amps, in differential amplifier topology, with no global feedback.},

	Dcterms.Abstract = {The current development of technology allows us to perform relatively simple and accessible measurements on audio systems, through audio interfaces and with high processing power computers. Audio systems are known all over the world for generating nonlinearities that usually please our ears, make the sound appear more full-bodied and somewhat more "alive." The objective of this work is to analyze, identify and model these nonlinearities from the exponential sinusoidal sweep method. The excitation signal that gives name to the method is used to make a frequency scan in the analyzed system. The system response is saved and then processed to obtain the parameters that make up the model used. For the representation of the nonlinear system we use Hammerstein's generalized polynomial model. In this work we study the proposed method with the intention of implementing it and validating its results through two experiments. The first experiment consists in modeling a simulated system in the computer and therefore already known. The second experiment involves the identification and modeling of a real non-linear audio device, a distortion pedal for guitar, SD-1 from Roland BOSS. The results were extremely satisfactory. As a validation criterion we estimate the relative mean square error (EMQ), comparing the model response generated by the method with the analyzed system response, when the two systems are excited by the same signal. For the first experiment we find the value of 0:1319% for the EMQ by analyzing the time response of the systems. In the second experiment, involving the real system, we obtained the value of 0:0014% for the EMQ, also analyzing the responses of the systems in time.},
